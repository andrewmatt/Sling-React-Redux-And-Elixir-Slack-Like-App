# Sling

---------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

---------------------

A Slack-Like App, created using the following tutorial: https://medium.com/@benhansen/lets-build-a-slack-clone-with-elixir-phoenix-and-react-part-1-project-setup-3252ae780a1

Added small-features for exercise (such as User Avatar).

---------------------

Start the app by first writing npm install (delete the json-package.lock if needed) and then npm start.
After that, access localhost:3000/ .
